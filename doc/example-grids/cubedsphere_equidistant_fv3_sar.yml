# Test for the regionally refined cubed-sphere grid that uses the equiangular 'FV3 flavour'
# formulation and projection. In this mode a Schmidt scaling is used with a stretching factor to
# effectively move grid points from one face to another. The target lon/lat is the center of the
# grid points with shortest grid spacing.
