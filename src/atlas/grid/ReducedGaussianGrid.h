// A gaussian grid is a latitude/longitude grid.
// The spacing of the latitudes is not regular.
// However, the spacing of the lines of latitude is symmetrical about the Equator.
// Note that there is no latitude at either Pole or at the Equator.
// A grid is usually referred to by its 'number' N, which is the number of lines of latitude between a Pole and the Equator.
// The longitudes of the grid points are defined by giving the number of points along each line of latitude.
// The first point is at longitude 0 and the points are equally spaced along the line of latitude.
// In a regular Gaussian grid, the number of longitude points along a latitude is 4*N.
// In a reduced Gaussian grid, the number of longitude points along a latitude is specified.
// Latitudes may have differing numbers of points but the grid is symmetrical about the Equator.
// A reduced gaussian grid may also be called a quasi-regular Gaussian grid.
//
// ? Global regular grids generated by interpolation have a longitude at 0 deg West.
// Latitude/longitude grids contain a line of latitude at the Equator, and gaussian grids are symmetrical about the Equator.

// land sea masks are not applied for reduced gaussian grid target grids, At the moment
//
// The Grib consist of sections  Geom, Bitmap(optional), Data
// We have following keys: numberofDataPoints,numberOfMissing,numberOf_CodedValues
// o When BitMap is present,(we have and array), it is for the global, 0 - Missing,  1- data value present
// o The bitsmap shows where we have Data values.
